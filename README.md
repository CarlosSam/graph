These are simple graph exercises.

** Use venv, unittest and eat your vegetables

* Create a virtual environment with venv

You know run: `python -m venv venv` and then `source venv/bin/activate`. Now you can run the code, run tests, play with the code, etc. When you are done you run `deactivate` and life goes back to boring normal

* Run unit tests with unit test

First enable your virtual environment. Then you can run unittests by calling the command `python -m unittest tests.test_depth_first_search` to run a single test case. To run the entire test suite run `python -m unittest`

* Eat well and exercise

* program and have fun
